# BitSynthPlus
In 2012, I build a free 8-bit synthesizer called BitSynth for the Windows Phone 7 platform. It has over 80k downloads, and enjoys a 4.3 star rating in the Store.

Today, I'm rebuilding this project from the ground up as a responsive Universal Windows app in C# and XAML. This is a work in progress, and still very much incomplete. Stay tuned...
